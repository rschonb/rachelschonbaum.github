                <h3>Dear University of Pennslyvania Admissions Officers,</h3>
                
                <p>
                    I'm so glad you've decided to look around my webpage and I want to thank you once again for putting time into the consideration of my application to Penn. There are a few things I'm hoping you'll get out of your exploration of this site, particularly this Penn-specific page, the <strong class="first">first</strong> thing being the University of Pennslyvania is my dream school and I'd attend without hesitation if given the chance. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I'm afraid my previous expressed interest in Penn hasn't been reflective of my reality. My SAT scores weren't where I wanted them to be at the time of Penn's early decision application round, but you probably already saw that.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The <strong class="second"> second </strong>thing I hope you'll get out of this site is a better understanding of me. I'm not sure if it's possible for me to portray my entire essence or self through this website, but I'll certainly try to show you some facets. A note: a lot of the filler content for my page will be my random or most current thoughts. I intend for that not to be an excuse, but rather an opportunity for you to learn a bit about my mind. Additionally, something I'd like to point out are my <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a> and <a href="thingsIlike.html">things I like </a>page. Although the content of the resume page is nothing new to you, it is interactive (ish) with respect to the coding. The other pages are mostly for upcoming events/projects.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The <strong class="third"> third </strong>point I'd like to come back to is the idea of time and value that I expressed in my previous letter of interest. Funny enough, my Penn timeline that I spoke about actually extends back further to a time before my birth. My father and uncle were born at the University of Pennslyvania's hospital and my grandfather worked at Penn for a small part life. Some months back, however, in a moment of unanticipated emotion, he told me that leaving Penn was one of the biggest regrets of his life. I know that sounds a little crazy, almost like a lie (fun fact: my middle name means wise and truthful in Korean), but it's just something that happened.
                </p>

                    <strong>I hope you check out this short video I made (it might take a second to load) and consider me for the Class of 2022. Thank you!</strong>
