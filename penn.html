                <h3>Dear University of Pennslyvania Admissions Officers,</h3>
                
                <p>
                    I'm so glad you've decided to look around my webpage and I want to thank you once again for putting time into the consideration of my application to Penn. There are a few things I'm hoping you'll get out of your exploration of this site, particularly this Penn-specific page, the <strong class="first">first</strong> thing being the University of Pennslyvania is my dream school and I'd attend without hesitation if given the chance.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I'm afraid my previous expressed interest in Penn hasn't been reflective of my reality. Honestly speaking, my SAT scores weren't where I wanted them to be at the time of Penn's early decision application round. 
                </p>
                
                <p>The <strong class="second"> second </strong>thing I hope you'll get out of this site is a better understanding of me. </p>
