                <h3>Dear University of Pennslyvania Admissions Officers,</h3>
                <p class="writing">I’m so glad you’ve decided to look at my webpage and thank you once again for considering my application. There are a few things I’m hoping you’ll get out of this website, the <strong class="first">first</strong> thing being: the University of Pennslyvania is my dream school and I'd attend without hesitation if given the chance. I’m afraid my previous expressed interest in Penn hasn’t been reflective of my reality. Despite circumstance (my SAT scores simply weren't good enough at the time) permitted me from applying in the early decision round and for monetary reasons I couldn't visit the campus. </p>
