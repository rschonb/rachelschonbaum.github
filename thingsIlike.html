                        “It could also disrupt Mr. Lee’s efforts to inherit management control of Samsung, whose tentacles in consumer electronics, shipbuilding and a range of other industries reach throughout South Korea’s economy.”

                        Politicians and military leaders sound increasingly belligerent and defense doctrines more dangerous. Commentators and TV personalities are joining the bellicose chorus. It all looks as if the world is preparing for war.

                        President John F. Kennedy gave a speech before the United Nations in which he said that “Every man, woman and child lives under a nuclear sword of Damocles, hanging by the slenderest of threads, capable of being cut at any moment by accident or miscalculation or by madness.”

                        “Like a great white shark, Bourdain tends to be photographed with his jaws wide open, on the verge of sinking his teeth into some tremulous delicacy."

                        Obama took a bite and let out a low murmur. “That’s good stuff” he said, and the two of them—lanky, conspicuously cool guys in late middle age—slurped away as three cameras, which Bourdain had once likened to “drunken hummingbirds,” hovered around them.

                        But if you spend any time with Bourdain you realize that he is controlled to the point of neurosis: clean, organized, disciplined, courteous, systematic. He is Apollo in drag as Dionysus.

                            I'm not a fan of the uppercase. I like the way a page looks when it is more than a fourth complete. Just a sentence or two is lame. Double space is also gross. 1.5 spacing at the most. I get it, it's hard to edit writing when it's single spaced, but use sticky notes. It's far more satisfying.
                        </p>
