                        I'm not a huge fan of writing these introductions to who I am. I'd like to go home and read my books (A Little Life and Under the Midnight Sun) then take a nap in the sun. I'd like to go on a walk to the lake and lie on the sand. It's not summer weather, but it's perfect for lying on the sand. I left my headphones at home, so I can't even listen to music. Music is important to me. I wouldn't show many people my playlist because it is weird and insane and, as one of my favorite sentences says, has tentacles in every genre of sound. There are days I'd like to paint my entire body in red acrylic paint.

                    <p><strong class="strong">Go on a walk</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        I'd highly recommend going on a walk. There is an explicit difference in walking somewhere (although that too is quite enjoyable) and going on a walk. You don't have to go super far. I usually only have 45 minutes to spare, sometimes less. There is this little foresty garden thing a couple blocks away from my school. It reminds me of some kind of garden you'd find in Narnia. In the winter it is quite beautiful. In the summer though, I prefer to walk to the lake. Actually, walking to the lake is always a good idea. When going on a walk you don't even have to constantly walk. Part of its allure is the sitting, the sky-staring, the listening. I sometimes lose my cool, usually not around people, and usually I'm pretty good at removing myself from the situation or restraining myself. In times when I'm so completely frustrated or angry or sad–mostly frustrated–I like to walk.
