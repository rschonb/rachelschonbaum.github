                    <p><strong class="strong">Who am I: Among all the duds</strong></p>
                    <p>I don't really like writing these statements about who I am. Frankly, I have no idea who I am and I don't think I'll ever be content having the ability to classify myself. Writing college applications was particularly difficult because more often than not, the expectation is that you have an idea of what you want to try. Sure, there isn't exactly an expectation that you'll know exactly what you'll do, but there certainly exists a perception that you cannot be more than one or two or three things. I like so much of life that sometimes it doesn't feel fair. I'm every contradiction. I cry and blubber with snot. I'm a hardass and value toughness. I'm independent. I am whatever I am. I'm pleased knowing I'm something else at every point in time. It might just be the quantum theory animations getting to me, but it all depends when you choose to observe me. I'd be happy to talk to you about something interesting! Find out more by digging around on this site. </p>
                    
                    <p><strong class="strong">Some days it's nice to think. Most days it's nice to walk</strong></p>
                    <p>Some days I'd like to just sit and think. Sometimes it's sit and listen to music. Othertimes it's walking and thinking and walking and listening and thinking. Most of my mental energy focuses on myself. Usually in the form of what am I doing and what would I like to do? How can I do something today, right now? What could I do? How do I want to be and live? Or it's about boys or grades. I'm just a kid afterall. Recommendation: take a second to stare sometimes and just think.</p>
