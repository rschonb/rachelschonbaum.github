              <p><strong>Classical Guitar </strong></p>
                <p>I've played classical guitar for six years. I stopped receiving lessons two years back, so now I mostly play on my own for my own. I never did any major performances, instead I played simply for the sake of wanting to learn guitar. I learned classical guitar just by chance.</p>

               <p><strong>Club Soccer – SSF, Chicago City </strong></p> 
              <p>I've played club soccer the majority of my life. Starting with AYSO, I went on to play for South Side Fire FC for something like seven or so years. I served as captain for most of my time on South Side, and played goalkeeper and midfield (although I can and have played quite literally every postion on the field). My last year of club soccer was with Chicago City FC.</p>
