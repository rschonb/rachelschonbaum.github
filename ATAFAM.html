                                    When around this time last year, President Trump announced budget cuts to the National Endowment for the Arts, a rather short-lived but vigorous outcry was heard from various art and humanities-based communities across the nation. Since the NEA’s establishment in 1965, a generally Republican-led campaign makes claims that the NEA is wasteful spending on behalf of the American government. Despite the fact that art has been a part of history since the dawn of human civilization, the arts have adopted an association with monetary privilege–both in terms of those producing art (the artists) and consuming the arts. This association stems from larger issues of funding disparities in public school systems, segregated city layouts, accessibility (physical and monetary) of artistic centers (museums, galleries, etc.), representation, unemployment among impoverished communities, the types of jobs members of these communities are more likely to have, political support (from programs like the NEA), and the list goes on. Given African Americans make up Chicago’s second largest demographic and Chicago has a historically rich artistic background, one would think this metropolitan would exist outside the majority of artistic hubs currently struggling to include and represent people of color. However, that is not the case. The plethora of issues with arts and African American representation in the arts that were previously mentioned permeate many facets of Chicago. These issues source from the national level, i.e. NEA funding or opinions on arts, to the local level, i.e. Chicago Public School (CPS) funding. The NEA budget was cut in half during both President Regan and President Clinton’s time in office. The result of diminished government support for the NEA leads to a reliance on private organizations and funding, which leads to further reliance on the opinions and backgrounds of those organizations. Often enough, as <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjGsr2J2pbaAhVq64MKHTl-DFQQFggpMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.chicagotribune.com%2Fentertainment%2Fct-trump-arts-endowment-ent-0317-20170316-column.html&usg=AOvVaw3L3GygOPIkcYHlCdCVFBSP">one source commented</a>, there is a lack of diversity

                                    in the organizations with money and impact.1 This creates a snowballing effect of money allocation to fewer communities. It was found that organizations with a budget of over <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/01/the-state-of-public-funding-for-the-arts-in-america/424056/">$10 million received about 50% of all contributing funds for the arts.</a>In addressing the disparity, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiFq47O2pbaAhUq2IMKHd2DDbIQFggpMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rand.org%2Fcontent%2Fdam%2Frand%2Fpubs%2Fmonograph_reports%2F2005%2FMR1323.pdf&usg=AOvVaw215YdbQz4tU6EYOljLnZ5C">one should question the attributing factors: socio- demographic characteristics, personality factors, past experience and social/cultural identity</a>. There is a cycle to the participation of different demographics in the arts, stemming from thosemain four factors, which are furthered by different factors (more perceptual and experiential). Because of this emphasis on background, looking at the participation disparity in terms of African American’s historical background in Chicago is of vast importance. Starting with the Worlds Fair to modern times, the general representation of African American art has been more about the exoticness than the actual art. Painter Norman Lewis was quoted near his passing (1979), saying <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/arts/design/black-artists-and-the-march-into-the-museum.html">“I think it’s going to take about 30 years, maybe 40, before people stop caring whether I’m black and just pay attention to the work.”</a> Norman Lewis brings up a frequent issue of African American art being either highlighted simply for its “African” connection rather than its American roots. Additionally, while some progress has been made with respect to recent exhibits and efforts, such as Chicago’s Black Creativity Gala, there <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/422434/summary">remains frustration that there is little help from outside the African American community to represent African American art</a>. Journals and newspapers tend to focus solely on exceptions of African American art representation, but reprimand the nationwide issues of arts funding.

                                        Arts in America have endured the weight of political and economic decisions dating back as far as   colonial America era where resources were allotted towards mostly religion or business. With the development of American society, depending on the political group in office, efforts were either made to build or repeal funds and support for the arts throughout the States. Often times the action of one side were met with a counteractive response to the previous decision: Under President Theodore Roosevelt efforts made to bring artists and performers to the White House (among other displays of support) were stopped by President Taft, then reconvened with President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and so on and so forth. Additionally, more often than not, efforts made to increase interest in the arts were either so severely under-funded that they ultimately failed or they simply weren’t followed through with (such was the case in 1891 when a bill to build the National Conservatory of Music was finally approved, but never ended up being built). What ultimately drove the government to change this mindset was the arising need to improve national prestige. Ironically enough, political decisions based on improving prestige and national image developed into one of the leading reasons behind the issue of misrepresentation and a lack of representation of African Americans in the arts. Maintained to this day, one of the most important acts in support of the arts was the National Endowment for the Arts under the Johnson administration in 1965. Disregarding stated intent, the enactment of the National Endowment for the Arts placed restrictions on the definition of American art and furthermore restricted funding for those, particularly African Americans, with non-pro-America artwork.

                                    <p>
                                        The National Endowment for the Arts relied on the opinions of an advisory committee, leaving the bias of the times as a driving force in the allocation of funding. The official statement for what the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) is states that the NEA “is a public agency dedicated to supporting excellence in the arts, both new and established; bringing the arts to all Americans; and providing leadership in arts education” through grants made by an advisory committee. The committee is appointed by the President, which again puts a heavy dependence on the mentality of the President with relation to the success of that program. This is seen from the repeated budget cuts the NEA has battled against over the past 50 or so years (particularly noting President Regan’s objections and today, President Trump’s proposed cuts). Often attempts at budget cuts made the case against arts funding because of its assumed association with luxury and waste.

                                        effort to improve prestige) could be built. Around the end of the Industrial Revolution (late 19th century), most urbanized and industrialized cities were considered “ugly” and “dangerous.” To combat this imagery, an architectural push for the construction of skyscrapers served to make Chicago seem a “more profitable place to do business,” spawning a collaboration between artist and capitalist that became popular among other major cities such as Boston and New York. This collaboration, among other reasons, became the foundation of one of the most prominent and maintained associations made in connection to the arts: participation in the arts–be it creating or spectating–is a waste of time and resources and is reserved to those with time and resources. Elitists and capitalists used the arts as a medium through which they could establish a sense of superiority over the common people and workers. Support for capitalist-driven artwork was far easier to sell than the controversy of some African American artwork. Proceeding with the caveat that not all African American artists were pulling from past experiences with discrimination, any showings of slavery, racial discrimination, police brutality, or social discontentment were rarely permitted. The NEA committee was in charge of defining what was acceptable as art and valuable as art. African American artists in Chicago have undoubtedly existed, even thrived (think Chicago Black Renaissance, blues and jazz scenes, etc.), but this was not the works of the NEA. Achieving the kind of formal and public support from the NEA equated to formulaic content that perpetuated a certain image of poshness and drove the very claims for budget cuts against the NEA.

                                    <p>
                                         Today’s issue with the National Endowment for the Arts, while a slightly different angle, takes the same format as these mid-20th century issues: unaccountability for the distribution of NEA-made grants limits diverse representation in the arts and perpetuates a self-destructive association with waste. When the NEA is pressed with budget cuts, a reliance on biased parties (donors) continues the unaccountability of resource distribution. Repeatedly, those with less similarities to the selection committee face difficulty in getting their work funded. What this maintained issue of funding and the arts boils down to is a repeated question of imagery. Briefly returning to the caveat previously mentioned, a separation of American art, the artist’s race, and content material has been a subtle, but nonetheless important social issue. The selection and exhibition of African American art as exotic or African art misrepresents the history (for African American artists with this intent) and content of the pieces. Ida B. Wells spoke of this distinction in the World's Columbian Exposition, as did modern day’s Norman Lewis. The ultimate goal being not putting their race on exhibition, rather their art and what their art has to say.

                                <p>One way in which some are solving this issue is by creating opportunties for themselves and banding together: . Although this and the following point aren't necessarily mutually exclusive, some artists don't focus on race as the narrative behind their art.</p>
                                <p>This is an email interview I conducted with Chicago architect and artist, <a href="http://awstudioart.com/home.html">Amanda Williams</a>.</p>
                              <p>
                                  <strong>What is your understanding of issues facing African American artists in trying to have their art represented?</strong>
                                </p>
                                <p class="interview">Until recently, black artists, like black (fill in the blank), have not enjoyed a great amount of interest from mainstream art world for representation. This meant being relegated to certain galleries or inventing our own modes of presentation and celebration of our work. Locally, the South Side Community Center and the work of Margaret Burroughs in particular stands alone for advancing the visibility and respect artists from the African diaspora have enjoyed.</p>
                                <p class="interview">There is no history of mainstream museums or galleries genuinely foregrounding any sort of access for communities of color. Organizations like South Side Community Art Center, DuSable Museum, National Museum of Mexican Art maybe even to some extent, Jane Addams Hull house...are all born of an absence of support from 'mainstream' institutions. The record of African Americans who were historically enrolled at  SAIC is not good. Institutions like Howard University have served as the foundation for black artists of the 20th century. We've seen a shift in recent years that marks an improvement, but the past decade or so really doesn't feel like a flood gate. I'm caught in the wave of it all and have not yet really analyzed or fully followed pivotal moments that have marked this tipping point. Hank Willis Thomas, a friend of mine from my California College of the Arts days, is the only artist that I personally know that I've observed go from modest interest to meteoric success internationally.  His wife is an emerging curator. The presence of black critics, and curators can't be underscored when thinking about ways in which Black artists are enjoying increased visibility in mainstream arts spaces.</p>
                                <p><strong>Is this an issue of the past?</strong></p>
                                <p class="interview">
                                    OF COURSE [the issue] still exists. For every Amanda Williams (locally), there are 50 other equally talented, thoughtful artists who don't get the same level of visibility. The issues I'm passionate about are genuine to my practice, but they also conveniently fit into a narrative that makes white people in particular, feel comfortable about contemplating in relationship to black identity or aesthetics. The pictures are alluring but can remain a surface reading /misreading
                                </p>
                                <p class="interview">
                                    Maria Gaspar, Rhonda Wheatly, Faheem Majeed, Cecil McDonald, Krista Franklin, Torkwase Dyson (Chicago born, NY based), Tonika Johnson, Juan Angel Chavez, are all local artists who make powerful work that is less able to be reduced to a single image or soundbite quote. You have to be uncomfortable and work hard. I think much of what I do let’s people off easy.
                                </p>
                                <p class="interview">
                                    Another issue is ALL artists these days have to do more than just make the art, and black artists in particular then have extra work to help create the breadcrumbs that contextualize their work for a mainstream audience or art world. It certainly feels better than say 1968, but it also seems to have some of the same unresolved issues of a lack of effort to truly comprehend art from a more holistic lens. 
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>What do you think are the implications of difficulty with access and representation</strong></p>
                                <p class="interview">
                                    See above. Also, obviously MONEY. If you make work that is hard to 'sell' or turn into objects, the task is all the more difficult. Rashayla Marie Brown is an amazing artist who refuses to be categorized. She sometimes uses the term 'undisciplinary' artist. Its perfect. How does the world deal with her! She is an enigma! And so then, WHAT and how is her work valued financially. We find ways for Sol LeWiit or Jenny Holzer. Who is making the effort to understand how to compensate Rashayla for her ideas?  I've been fortunate to have created work that is both ephemeral and also accessible in a way that makes people want to fund future works. I take notes from other artists who've historically negotiated these things. In that sense, I've had it relatively easy compared to my fore-mothers and fathers.  The article i sent described the surge in a few national galleries (mostly NY) stockpiling the work of black artists because black sells right now.

                                    In my research there are really two major prongs of challenges African Americans face when it comes to participation and representation in the arts and both prongs come out of this idea of image. The first prong is the issue of some African American artists (although this might extend to any artist) wanting to separate their background from their art. So, for example, Norman Lewis explained that he wanted at some point not to be seen as a black artist, but rather as an artist. 
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>
                                    Do you think this is more of a modern day issue where you have funders of the arts trying to simply have some touch of diversity for the sake of being commended for their “inclusion” without any nods to the actual art?</strong>

                                    I'm not sure that its as explicit or 1 dimensional as that, but there is a kind of perverse excitement white people get from seeing black plight aestheticized. Seeing an Ultrasheen house beautifully photographed and reduced to 50 word descriptions make those of privilege feel like they connect to the problem a bit better.  There are inherently complicated questions about audience, agenda, etc. that come into play. Its not lost on me that artists who want to just paint yellow lines over and over again who happen to be black or asian, will then be expected to situate their mark or representational gesture in their ethnic, gender or sexual orientation. This is the way contemporary art was (maybe is still) structured. An assumption about how 'reading' of any work had to operate. There are shelves in art historic sections of the library that are much more well versed on this history and its recent manifestation.

                                    <strong>Do you think it’s the responsibility of artists of color to be artists of their color as opposed to just being artists? Is it okay to be both? Is it possible to be both? Why or why not?</strong>
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p class="interview">
                                    I think artists should live their truth. Like any other creative medium, sometimes that's biographical in a certain way, sometimes its experimental, sometimes in contextual, sometimes is none of that...the limitation of black artists is there is an increased likelihood that if there is not a clear through-line of a black artists' biography, they aren't as likely to have their practice foregrounded. The work is deemed "less accessible" based on mainstream standards. Its definitely NOT the responsibility of the artists to alter their work or package it in identity politics. There should finally be a enough room for works that do both. And it SHOULDN'T be the responsibility of Black artists (or other artists of color) to connect such dots for museum execs, trustees, donors, collectors, curators, patrons, etc.

                                     I occupy a position of privilege on many levels. My entire background is absolutely true, but it also threads together in a way that people feel is relatable. This aspect of my narrative isn't lost on me.  There's an imbalance that exists and its not the artist's job to take on the burden of addressing it.

                                     No. I'm not a proponent of change. I speak out if asked, but I want to be an artist, and having to always lead systemic change in addition to making my work seems like an unfair burden not placed on my white male counterparts.

                                 <p class="interview">I want those who have benefited from the imbalance and those who don't think the imbalance affects them at all to help solve the problem. Those who enjoy privilege and power need to do that work. Artists can co-sign and advocate as it fits their proclivity, but it does smell of 'victim blaming' to always turn to those more oppressed to also expend a lion's share of the energy solving the problem they didn't create but are most negatively impacted by.
